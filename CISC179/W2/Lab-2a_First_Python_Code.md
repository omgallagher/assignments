## This is my assignment code
### a.

```python
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```
### b.
```python
print("""All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.""")
```
### c.
```python
input
print("127","0","0","1", sep=".")
output
127.0.0.1
```
### d.
```python
flush=True: Is used when an immediate output is needed, like for real-time logging.

```
### e.
```python
What triggers the flush is the end="\n" argument.
```

;What challenges I faced was trying to figure out how to get the outputs in part c
